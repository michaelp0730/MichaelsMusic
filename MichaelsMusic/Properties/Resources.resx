    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

  <data name="Collings_290_DC_Description" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>&lt;p&gt;Some things are simply better in pairs. With a double-cutaway mahogany body and dual hand-wound P90 pickups from Jason Lollar, the 290 DC offers unhindered access to the upper frets and a wide range of tonal possibilities. From pristine clean tones with rich harmonic complexity to hard-hitting classic rock sounds, there are few bases the 290 DC cannot cover. To further the guitar's vintage-inspired tone and aesthetic, we've made available our own custom wraparound tailpiece (optional) that's been designed to deliver unsurpassed dynamic range and improved intonation up the neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Premium Tonewoods&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Collings 290 is constructed of solid Honduran mahogany that is acquired, acclimated, and hand selected for density and acoustical response by master luthiers here at our shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Electronics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Soapbar P90 has a fat and round bass response with a smoother treble than a traditional P90.  This is a hugely versatile pickup with lots of vintage-style warmth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Playability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A combination of exacting PLEK machine leveling and hand fret dressing ensures consistently excellent playability and a silky fret feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being constructed of all mahogany, each 290 can be finished with a variety of colors and full body sunbursts, including our custom Doghair finish.&lt;/p&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;Chris Cornell is something of a modern legend, playing with big names Soundgarden, Audioslave and Temple of the Dog, Cornell has helped shape modern rock music like very few others. This semi-hollow laminate maple instrument is built with the man himself in mind, taking the traditional thin-line hollow-body design and including the addition of Jason Lollar™ Lollartron® Filter'Tron pickups that perfectly combines the traditional '335 dot' design with modern appointments.&lt;/p&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;The G&amp;amp;L Legacy™ blends contemporary refinements from the Leo Fender†-designed S-500™ and Comanche® models with classic Alnico V pickups. If your holy grail is faithful Alnico single-coil tone with modern refinements and superb craftsmanship, the Legacy makes for an excellent choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Legacy’s vintage-spec CLF-100 Alnico V pickups have that unmistakable chime and quack reminiscent of the best examples from the late ‘50s, thanks to the work of Paul Gagon, G&amp;amp;L VP Engineering. Gagon found his inspiration reviewing original prints stored in Leo’s private laboratory at G&amp;amp;L, but that was just the start. About 30 years ago, Gagon was an R&amp;amp;D engineer at another company when he was tasked with finding out what was so special about the early bolt-on guitars many players raved about. Gagon tirelessly analyzed many examples of what were considered holy grail guitars, spending time out on the shop floor talking to builders still working in the pickup department since the ‘50s, all on a quest to discover where the real mojo was – and wasn’t. What he learned from the builders matched his own engineering analysis. You see, back in the day, the actual spec of pickups coming that down that old production line varied considerably. That meant coming up with the right specs for the Legacy pickups was more challenging than simply following the prints. Gagon’s persistence paid off as the Legacy garnered rave reviews from both players and magazines like Guitar Player and Guitar World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This axe is no slave to the past, however, starting with Leo’s PTB™ (Passive Treble and Bass) system which functions on all three pickups for dramatically more variety than the vintage setup. What’s more, the Legacy features a Leo Fender-designed Dual-Fulcrum vibrato, a work of engineering art which allows bending up or down with unsurpassed stability, while offering a silky feel through its beefy aluminum vibrato arm. The Legacy’s hard-rock maple neck features an easy-playing satin finish, comfortable 9 1/2" radius and Jescar 57110 medium-jumbo nickel-silver frets for silky playability. The moment you open the luxurious hardshell case, you’ll be greeted with a stunning instrument and delicious aroma that’ll have your pulse racing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded by Leo Fender in 1980, G&amp;amp;L USA instruments continue to be made in the historic G&amp;amp;L facility on Fender Avenue in Fullerton, California, the Birthplace of Bolt-on™.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    <value>&lt;p&gt;We took the vintage guitar of your imagination, the one you secretly have always hoped to find in perfect condition at a garage sale, and improved it beyond your wildest electric guitar dreams. Wildest! Nowhere near a copycat of any kind, Icon lifts you on wings of unprecedented playability, tonality and resonance that are really astounding.  Giant vintage tones resound beyond normal expectations and unlimited string bends abound—push ‘em as far as you can push—still ringing out. So truly satisfying to play!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Icon is in production and it is magnificent.  It is the no compromise vintage guitar. Icon (like all Anderson Guitars):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Nimble and comfortable to hold and gig with all night long&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Wonderfully hand-selected vintage woods that are dried to perfection, with no rushing&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Rings out loudly, even unplugged&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Sustain “for days.” with rich beautiful tonality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Icon does it in a totally iconic way, and with no vintage compromises. Icon has the look but not the limited playability, so all the Anderson attributes are soundly intact with the vintage visual attractions of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Full-sized S-style body silhouette&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Top Jack&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Three numbered knobs&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;One rear strap button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you could say: Icon looks just right and plays just right.  And almost every Anderson option is available, as long as it does not alter the time-honored look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting aspect of Icon is that many are ordered with Satin Finishes. We have the smoothest Satin finishes in all the colors.  But if your preference is a shimmering shine we have all those wonderful Gloss colors as well.  What is the one color that you have always imagined yourself holding?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what is the best part of dreams?  It is the moment you awaken to find that reality now exceeds them.&lt;/p&gt;</value>
